# ðŸ‘‹ Hallo, I'm Sumon

*Presently, I'm immersed in a fulfilling role with a German company. This means my capacity for new projects is a bit restricted right now.*

I have extensive expertise in all things related to the **PHP** language, including but not limited to **MVC frameworks**, **CMS's**, **Database design**, and **RESTful APIs**.

Whether it's web security, **DevOps**, or **cross-platform development**, I've got it covered.

I value every connection, so even if I'm currently engaged, don't hesitate to drop me a message. Let's stay in touch!
